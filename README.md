# Parameter Selection for the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES)

### Summary
Numerical models that simulate tropical forest ecosystem dynamics, such as the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES), have been proposed as a way to improve climate change projections. However, parameterizing these complex, process-based models is challenging due to their numerous and interconnected non-linear relationships. This code identifies three high-performing FATES parameter sets by quantitatively evaluating the performance of nearly 300 simulations, each run with a unique parameter set, against observations at a tropical forest test site.
